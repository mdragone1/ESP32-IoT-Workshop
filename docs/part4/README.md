# Part 4

This part of the workshop will require you to train a machine learning model to be used with your device.
You will use a Jupyter Notebook.
Previous versions of this workshop made use of a Jupyter Notebook hosted by IBM Cloud.
However, you are raccomended to use an open-source, free-tier service, for instance by opening an account with https://www.datacamp.com/, as the service allows you to create Jupyter notebooks.
Alternatively, you could install Jupyter Lab on your own laptop, see https://jupyter.org/install
 
## Create training data

This section shows you how to create the training data needed to create a model so you will be able to determine what is happening from the sensor data.

- Estimated duration: 20 min
- practical [**Training Data**](TRAINING.md)

## Jupyter Notebook Analytics - Create model

This section shows you how to use the training data to create a model that can then be used to classify actions.

- Estimated duration: 20 min
- practical [**Jupyter Notebook - ESP32**](JUPYTER.md)

## Run the model on the ESP32 device

This section takes the output from the Jupyter Notebook and implements the trained model on the ESP8266 device.

- Estimated duration: 20 min
- practical [**Implement model on ESP32**](MODEL.md)

## Workshop summary

This section summarises what the workshop covered and also provides some useful links for further exploration of IoT and Data Science
