# Part 2

## Creating the Initial Application

In this lab exercise you will pull together all the information from part 1 into a single app.

- Estimated duration: 15 min
- Practical: [**Create ESP32 Application**](APP.md)

## Introduction to the MQTT Protocol

In this lab exercise you will learn how to add MQTT messaging to an application.

- Estimated duration: 15 min
- Practical: [**Sending Data Using MQTT**](MQTT.md)

## Introduction to IoT Security Techniques
IMPORTANT: You can skip this step as you do not need to implement a secure MQTT connection.
This step will be shown as a tutorial in class.
The instructions below do not work with new (>=2.0) Arduino IDE
In this lab exercise you will modify MQTT to use a secure connection.

- Estimated duration: 25 min
- Practical: [**Securing MQTT Traffic Using Self-Signed Certificate**](CERT1.md)

## Adding Client Certificates
IMPORTANT: You can skip this step as you do not need to implement a secure MQTT connection.
This step will be shown as a tutorial in class.
The instructions below do not work with new (>=2.0) Arduino IDE
In this lab exercise you will extend the application by enabling client side certificates.

- Estimated duration: 10 min
- Practical: [**Securing MQTT Traffic Using a Client Certificate**](CERT2.md)
