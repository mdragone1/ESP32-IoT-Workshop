# Resources

Here are all the links and resources used within the workshop, as well as some other useful links and information to help you to continue to explore IoT:

## ESP8266 Resources

Documentation for the library installed with the Arduino ESP8266 plugin can be found at the [ESP8266 Arduino reference](https://arduino-esp8266.readthedocs.io/en/2.7.2/).

Development options:

- [ESP8266 Arduino repo](https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino)
- [Espressif ESP8266 site](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp8266/overview)

Some additional links:

- [ESP8266 pinout](https://circuits4you.com/2017/12/31/nodemcu-pinout/)
- [Wikipedia link to ESP8266](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP8266)
- [Wikipedia link to NodeMCU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NodeMCU)

## ESP32 Resources

Documentation for the library installed with the Arduino ESP32 plugin can be found at the [ESP32 Arduino reference](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/arduino-esp32/en/latest/installing.html).

Development options:

- [ESP32 Arduino repo](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32)
- [Espressif ESP32 site](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32)

Some additional links:

- [Wikipedia link to NodeMCU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NodeMCU)

## Cloud platforms and Internet of Things Resources

Some free (no credit-card) cloud platform you can use for this assignment.
An alternative option is to install all server-side components on your own laptop.
In that case you will need to connect the laptop to the same network of your ESP32 device (e.g. using a hot spot with your phone)

- [Mosquitto MQTT broker](https://mosquitto.org/)
- [HIVEMQ public MQTT broker](https://www.hivemq.com/public-mqtt-broker/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/) Heriot-Watt students can have a free account for up to a month with ~$200 credit
